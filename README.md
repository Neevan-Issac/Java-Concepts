# Class Demonstrations

## OOP Principles

### Encapsulation
Keep data members private, to ensure no-one can alter the value of your variables.
Instead use access methods and setters to change and retrieve the value of the data members.

### Inheritance
We can inherit attributes and methods from our parent classes.
The super class is the class being inherited
The sub class is the class that is inheriting the attributes and methods

Parent and child relationship is established.

### Polymorphism 
Allows for method overloading and method overriding
