# Class Demonstrations

## OOP Principles

### Encapsulation
Keep data members private, to ensure no-one can alter the value of your variables.
Instead use access methods and setters to change and retrieve the value of the data members.

### Inheritance
We can inherit attributes and methods from our parent classes.
The super class is the class being inherited
The sub class is the class that is inheriting the attributes and methods

Parent and child relationship is established.

### Polymorphism 
Allows for method overloading and method overriding 

### Abstraction 
We don't need to show the implementation details to every class or method
Abstraction only shows essential information to a user.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, meaning we cannot create objects from them
Abstract methods are apart of an abstract class however they don't have a body, they are implemented in the child class.

### Interfaces
Interfaces encourage smart application design
Java doesn't support multiple exxtensions. A class can **only** have one super class but can have **multiple** interfaces.
Interfaces is completely abstracted, none of the methods have bodies.
